# sreed-web-programming

Web programming project using Vue JS to create a simple store web application.

[Tutorial series followed](https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/intro-to-vue-3/forms-and-v-model-vue3)

This project uses [Vue Single File Components](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-spec.html), which in general must be built into the project using `vue-cli`.

[Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) is also used to read a static JSON file to populate reviews on the product.
